Welcome,

This project will introduce visitors to a beautiful manor farm B&B in North Wales in a responsive four page website. A hero gallery header at the top with text in the lower third of a drone video of the whole property. The video flows into a carousel of images of the amenities both on the property and nearby towns. There is a book now button that links to a calendar page detailing all available rental dates. The main content begins with a features section below the hero gallery with clickable cards containing a picture and descriptive text for each rental space on the property. These links scroll down through images under text for each of the rental spaces to a table of availability and pricing for each rental space. There is an interactive booking calendar that links to the booking form at the bottom of each card. The booking form links to a success page which triggers a confirmation email. The success page has a Thank You! message and a button linking back to the home page. Following the features section is a testimonials section that completes the main content of the home page. Descriptions of the experiences of previous guests are detailed in three cards with links to their google reviews and pics from their stay or their google profile pic. Below the main content in the footer are the social media links and contact details.
